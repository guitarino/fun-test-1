# fun-test-1
A [random test](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/75zyrm/this_onsite_coding_assignment_failed_20_frontend/) I saw on reddit.

## Description

Develop a Backend + Front-end solution that allows your user to annotate a blob of text [...]

### Task 1

Allow the selection of a single token, at once [...]

### Task 2

The page may have multiple selected tokens. A token can be deselected [...]

### Task 3

When the user selects a word that starts with a vowel it gets associated the tag 'Baky'; all other tokens get associated with the tag 'Kola'. Display them differently in the UI.

## Results

So, it took me 2h 22m to finish **Task 1**. Then, I decided to take a better approach by reconsidering what token position really is, and it took a while to rewrite the code. **Task 2** was finished at 3h 24m mark, and **Task 3** was finished at 3h 40m mark. Not terrible.
